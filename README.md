# SOLVING 200 LEETCODE QUESTIONS

## What is this community?
This study group will serve the purpose of building an open source community which codes and prepare for Tier-1 companies together. The aim is not to become a competitive programmer. Go ahead and add your friends or siblings.

## Which programming language to pick?
Any programming language with OOPs is acceptable. But Java or Python is recommended.

## Why OOPs?
Because later on you will be building the projects using these languages.

## What do you need to become a member of this group?
You just have to be disciplined and punctual to become a member of this group. You will be removed from the group if any of this lags.

Three Hours per day dedication.

## WARNINGS:
- The path ahead is going to be bumpy and difficult. Join at your own risk.
- Dedicate at-least 3 hours per day. Sundays will be off. Over doing something is also dangerous.
- We will be coding for at-least 2 months daily to see some improvements.
